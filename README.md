## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.


### Prerequisites

Instructions for installing these software are listed in the next section: Installing. 

* Python 2.7

Python packages:

* basemap
* difflib
* matplotlib
* pandas
* numpy


### Installing

If your computer does not already have Python **2.7** installed, download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

By default, Python should come with pip (a package manager). Use it to install the following dependencies by opening the Terminal/command line and entering the commands as follows, each line as a separate command (make sure to capitalize Tkinter):

```
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
```

After installing these other Python packages, move on to installing Basecamp. Directions [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap).
